### Purpose

The purpose of this application is to make planning things with a big group easier. This is done by removing clutter data such as a conversation, and only focus on places on a pinboard. Every user can vote once on a place but on multiple places. In the end you can see what place is most popular and you can go there with the help of a built in map.
