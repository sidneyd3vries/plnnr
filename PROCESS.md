# Day 2
Made a start in the design document, made sketches and flowchart for interaction between activities and API's

# Day 3
Pitch gave new ideas for app; replace the chat system with just the pinboard/list of plans. The chat is not a critical part of the app so it can be easily replaced. Remade flowcharts and sketches to match new idea

# Day 4
Spent most of the day trying to update google play services and getting google maps API working. Took way more time than I wanted. Finished the navigation and most basic functions of the app for the demo.

# Day 5
Brainstorming about the structure of my database, might change later because the demo gave ideas to change the pinboard system.

# Day 6
Found out part of the api I wanted to use is deprecated, now looking for/ thinking about alternatives. Fixed bug that froze app on login. Fixed maps fragment not showing correct location on load. Api querying works, should now be able to add all search results to the map

# Day 7
